# Speech Emotion Recognition
Keeping in mind that recognizing and predicting emotions accurately from speech is a challenging task due to speech-related factors, the primary goal of this project is to classify emotions from a given speech sample in the most appropriate manner. In this project, we aim to explore different methods of predicting emotions, including the MLP Classifier (Version 0), the LSTM (Version 1), and the Query2Label (Q2L)(Version 2). These methods will be compared and evaluated to determine which approach yields the most accurate results. By contributing to this exciting and rapidly evolving field of research, we hope to advance our understanding of speech emotion recognition and its potential applications in various domains. The emotions we seek to classify in this research include happy, angry, neutral, sad, and excited. Each of these emotions has unique characteristics that make them distinct from one another.
